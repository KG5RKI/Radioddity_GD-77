Fixed the bug where every DMR channel must use an Rx Group List including the Tx Contact. Also includes direct TG entry by entering # TG_NUMBER #. Note. The radio always goes back to the first channel in the zone when you turn it on, and will not remember if it was left in VFO mode. Ensure you are not in the VFO before installing this firmare. "/>
